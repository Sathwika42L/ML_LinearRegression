Simple Linear Regression with One Variable
Project Description
This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model using one independent variable to predict a dependent variable. Linear regression is a foundational machine learning algorithm that models the relationship between a scalar response (dependent variable) and one explanatory variable (independent variable) by fitting a linear equation.

For this example, the project predicts a continuous target variable, such as predicting housing prices based solely on the area in square feet.

Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains two columns:

Feature (X): The independent variable (e.g., area in square feet).
Target (y): The dependent variable (e.g., housing price).
The data is preprocessed and loaded from a CSV file named data.csv.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Load and clean the data (handle any missing values).
Data Visualization: Plot the data points to visualize the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
Train the Model: Train a simple linear regression model using Scikit-learn.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
Prediction: Use the model to make predictions on new data.
Model Evaluation
The model’s performance is evaluated using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average of the squared differences between actual and predicted values.
R-squared (R²): Measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable.
Results
The model’s results are visualized in a plot that shows the fitted regression line against the original data points. This visualization helps in understanding how well the model fits the data.
